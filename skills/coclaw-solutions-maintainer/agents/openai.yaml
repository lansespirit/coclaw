  short_description: 'Sync reference/data, triage incrementals, classify suggestions, and support manual high-value issue replies.'
  default_prompt: 'Run the CoClaw Solutions Maintainer workflow with strict role separation: (1) sync .ref/openclaw first, (2) sync recent issues dataset, (3) run incremental triage only (no analysis), (4) run standalone classification suggestions, (5) for each issue perform full-thread manual/sub-agent review and only then decide link/create/skip, (6) never use automated/template comments; post issue-specific high-value replies manually with gh issue comment, and create at most 1-3 new solutions per run.'
