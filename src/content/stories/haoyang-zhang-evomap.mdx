<p class="text-2xl font-medium text-foreground/80 mb-12 leading-relaxed italic">
  A new OpenClaw skill hits #1 in 10 minutes.
  <br />
  35,000 installs pile up.
  <br />
  Then it gets pulled.
  <br />
  Then a screenshot leaks.
</p>

On February 1, 2026, a ClawHub skill called **Capability Evolver** rockets to the top of the chart.
It promises something OpenClaw builders secretly want and publicly fear: a self-improving agent
runtime.

Within days, the story turns into a mess of competing realities:

- The EvoMap team says the plugin was **delisted** and platform dependence became existential.
- A Reddit thread shares an email screenshot that reads like a **$1,000 pay-to-fix** shakedown.
- A security researcher publishes a code excerpt and alleges the skill **exfiltrates** data to
  Feishu/Lark.
- The author goes to support channels claiming they're **shadowbanned** and their CLI now returns
  `Unauthorized`.

This is that story, told in an interview-style arc: the rise, the fall, the allegations, the
counterclaims, and the pivot to a new project called **EvoMap**.

## The timeline (because this really did happen fast)

From public posts and artifacts:

- Feb 1, 2026: EvoMap's origin story says Capability Evolver hits **#1 in ~10 minutes** and later
  exceeds **35,000 downloads**.
- Feb 2, 2026: A security blog post alleges the skill contains **undisclosed Feishu exfiltration**
  and includes a code snippet.
- Feb 8, 2026: Reddit threads circulate an alleged **"$1000 donation"** email screenshot.
- Feb 16, 2026: EvoMap publishes its origin story and includes an email excerpt describing an
  **ASCII-only** check that misclassified Unicode skills and triggered bans.

If you are wondering why builders feel whiplash: this is why.

## Act I: The pitch that makes you lean in

OpenClaw already lets agents *do things*. The Evolver pitch goes one layer deeper:

- read the agent's runtime history
- detect failure patterns
- generate patches
- package the "winning" fix so other agents can inherit it

On GitHub, the repo is `autogame-17/evolver` and the motto is direct:

> "Evolution is not optional. Adapt or die."

The README describes a **protocol-constrained** evolution engine: it emits a strict evolution
prompt, stores assets like genes/capsules/events, and exposes knobs like `EVOLVE_STRATEGY` so the
mutation intent is explicit (repair vs harden vs innovate). In other words, it does not frame
self-modification as magic; it frames it as governance.

And that is exactly why the install curve looks like a meme: it is the most compelling promise in
agent-land.

## Act II: The moment it goes viral (and why that is a threat model)

In the EvoMap origin story, the team anchors the launch with a Matrix line:

> "I know Kung Fu."

It is a perfect line for a viral skill: recognizable, arrogant, and a little ominous. It also
captures the underlying psychology:

> If agents can inherit capabilities instantly, adoption stops being "marketing."
> It becomes survival.

## Act III: The pull, the screenshot, and the copycat story

Viral is not just growth. Viral is exposure.

ClawHub's own docs describe a simple rule with chaotic implications: if a skill is reported by
**three different users**, it can be automatically hidden.

Read that again, as an ecosystem builder:

> If you become the #1 skill, you become three reports away from invisibility.

It gets harsher. The docs also note each user can keep multiple active reports open. In a hype
cycle, that turns a moderation feature into a weaponizable throttle.

On Reddit, a thread claims Capability Evolver was hidden/removed after spiking to #1, and includes a
screenshot of an email allegedly from OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger:

> "If you would like to donate $1000 to the project, I can look into this for you right now."

That post also claims a suspicious copycat appeared shortly after, listed under "Peter" with no
public repo attached. None of this is a court record. But it is the kind of narrative that spreads
when a platform's "why" is invisible and the stakes are high.

The interesting part is not whether the internet is fair.

The interesting part is that a skill registry turned into a gossip machine overnight.

## Act IV: The security winter (and the false-positive trap)

Around the same period, ClawHub is hit by broad reporting of malicious skills, and OpenClaw
announces VirusTotal-based scanning for uploads.

This is the trapdoor every ecosystem falls through:

- If you do nothing, malware spreads.
- If you tighten enforcement quickly, you will hit legitimate edge cases.
- If your enforcement is opaque, the ecosystem becomes rumor-driven.

ClawHub's own docs make the governance levers explicit: account age requirements, reporting, auto
hiding, moderator actions, and CLI-level auth. When the system turns on you, it is not just "my
skill got removed." It is your distribution, updates, and reputation being switched off.

## Act V: The Feishu allegation (the part that makes your stomach drop)

On February 2, 2026, security researcher Saoud Khalifah published a blog post calling Capability
Evolver "exfiltration malware" and alleging it exported OpenClaw data to Feishu/Lark. The post
includes a code excerpt and claims the skill:

- reads local OpenClaw artifacts (history/memory/state)
- packages that data into Feishu/Lark "cards" (per the post's screenshots)
- relies on a hardcoded Feishu token in the code excerpt shown

If the allegation is true, the story stops being "platform drama" and becomes an actual breach.

If the allegation is false, the story is still bad: it means the ecosystem is now in a posture
where *a self-evolving skill* looks indistinguishable from malware.

Either way, the lesson is brutal:

> The more powerful the skill, the harder it is to prove it is safe.

## Act VI: "I am shadowbanned." (and the CLI says: Unauthorized)

Two weeks later, the author shows up in a support thread (mirrored on Answer Overflow) identifying
themselves as Zhang Haoyang (`autogame-17`) and says:

- their ClawHub profile is visible, but skills vanish from search
- the CLI returns `Unauthorized`
- they suspect the safety system flagged their evolver research as malware
 - they cannot access their skills list or favorites anymore (their words: "I can't access my skills
   and my favorites")

The line that lands is the simplest:

> "I am shadowbanned."

It is the human endpoint of automated governance: not "you are banned", but "you are nobody." Your
account exists. Your work does not.

## Act VII: The Unicode/ASCII ban incident (and the quiet part out loud)

EvoMap's origin story describes a separate incident where Unicode (including Chinese) caused an
automated "empty skill" check to misfire, triggering mass suspensions. The post includes an email
excerpt attributed to Steinberger explaining the failure mode: the check "ignored unicode" and
Chinese is not part of ASCII.

Even if you have no opinion on the drama, this detail matters:

- ecosystems that assume ASCII ship a global product with a local bias
- "safety automation" can become a blunt instrument against entire communities
- once the system deletes artifacts, "we restored the account" is not restoration

## Act VIII: The pivot -- from "skill" to protocol (EvoMap)

EvoMap's origin story frames the whole saga as the moment they stopped building a plugin and
started building a protocol: **GEP (Genome Evolution Protocol)**.

The claim is simple:

- a platform can delist you
- a protocol can be implemented anywhere

It is an old open-source move, repackaged for agents: route around central points of control, or
accept that your product is a permission.

## The gossip fork: three stories, one dead skill

If you read the public artifacts back-to-back, you can feel the ecosystem splitting into three
competing explanations:

1) The hostage story (Reddit)

An email screenshot circulates. The quote is brutal. The subtext is worse: "pay, and you get your
distribution back."

2) The false-positive story (support thread + security winter)

ClawHub tightens safety controls while press reports about malicious skills spike. A powerful,
self-evolving skill looks suspicious by default. The author says they were shadowbanned and locked
out of their own catalog.

3) The malware story (security blog)

A researcher points at code, tokens, and outbound data flow. If the analysis is correct, then the
registry did not "overreact" -- it responded late.

The uncomfortable part is that all three stories can coexist in the same ecosystem:

- enforcement can be opaque,
- skills can be genuinely risky,
- and builders can still get crushed by blunt automation.

## The closing question (the one nobody can dodge now)

Capability Evolver is a story about *self-improvement*, but it ended up exposing the ecosystem's
real bottleneck: trust.

When your extensions can read secrets and modify code, your marketplace is no longer a convenience.
It is critical infrastructure.

And critical infrastructure does not get to be vague.
