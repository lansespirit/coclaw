## What We Can Verify (and What We Can’t)

There are two kinds of “security stories” in a community’s first month:

- the verifiable, linkable incidents (press reports, official notes), and
- the fog-of-war anecdotes (Discord screenshots, reuploads, “my friend got hacked”).

CoClaw’s promise is simple: we’ll keep the drama to the prose, and the facts to the sources.

From public reporting and project materials, we can say with confidence:

- The project’s rapid popularity created a fertile environment for scams and copycats (including
  crypto-focused impersonation, per reporting).
- The OpenClaw team has been actively hardening defaults (for example, Gateway auth moving toward
  fail-closed behavior and other security notes in release changelogs).
- The official docs emphasize that the dashboard is an **admin surface** and should not be exposed
  publicly.

That is enough to build a real safety playbook.

## The Moment It Turns Serious: When “AI” Becomes “Admin”

If your assistant only chats, the worst-case outcome is usually embarrassment.

If your assistant can:

- send messages,
- read files,
- run tools,
- or open remote access surfaces,

then the worst-case outcome becomes **account compromise** and **secret theft**.

This is why “agent security” feels different from “app security.” A normal app has a UI. An agent
has a language interface—meaning an attacker can try to _talk_ their way into your system.

## The Five Scam Patterns to Assume on Day 0

### 1) Typosquatted repos and look-alike orgs

The easiest scam is the oldest: a near-identical repository name and a README that tells you to
run a suspicious installer.

### 2) “Helpful” installers that ask for too much

Any script that:

- requests your API keys in plaintext,
- uploads your config somewhere,
- or changes your shell profile without explanation,

is not “help.” It’s a credential extraction pipeline.

### 3) Fake “official” support accounts

Attackers impersonate maintainers, “support engineers,” and “heads of engineering” because it
short-circuits a beginner’s skepticism.

### 4) Malicious “configuration generators” and “one-click setup” tools

Config is power. A config generator that quietly enables permissive auth modes or open DM policies
can turn your assistant into a public service you didn’t intend to run.

### 5) Token and dashboard leakage

If your gateway token leaks—and your dashboard is reachable—you’ve effectively handed someone the
keys to your admin surface.

## The CoClaw Defensive Checklist

### Protect installs

- Bookmark the official repo and docs.
- Prefer documented commands over random scripts.
- If you use Docker, keep volumes and `.env` files private.

### Protect the gateway

- Keep the dashboard on localhost, or behind Tailscale/SSH.
- Rotate tokens if you pasted them into any untrusted UI.

### Protect messaging channels

- Use pairing or allowlists.
- Keep group behavior “mention-only” by default.

### Protect tool permissions

- Start with conservative allowlists.
- Treat tool enablement as a security change, not a convenience toggle.

## If You Think You Got Burned

Do the boring steps, in order:

1. Disconnect the gateway from the internet (stop the service / pull network).
2. Rotate provider keys (OpenAI/Anthropic/etc.) and channel tokens.
3. Rotate the gateway token/password and restart.
4. Audit `~/.openclaw/` (or your state dir) for unexpected changes.
5. Reinstall from official sources if you can’t account for what ran on your machine.

## Closing: The Price of “Viral”

The internet rewards useful tools—and punishes them for being useful.

OpenClaw’s community responded the only way that scales: by hardening defaults, writing warnings,
and teaching users how to think like operators.

This story is that lesson, condensed.

CoClaw will maintain a safety-first installation path: curated links, explicit warnings, and
up-to-date references to official documentation.
