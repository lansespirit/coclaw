## What Happened (High Level)

Reporting described a malicious extension that could exfiltrate secrets and attempt remote access.
The broader pattern is familiar: popular projects attract "helper tools" that are not maintained or
reviewed by the original authors.

## What You Should Do

- Do not install random extensions or scripts that claim to "auto-configure" OpenClaw.
- Rotate any keys/tokens if you installed suspicious software.
- Keep dashboards local (127.0.0.1) or behind VPN with authentication.
- Use conservative allowlists, pairing, and minimal tool permissions.

CoClaw will maintain a safety-first installation path: curated links, explicit warnings, and
up-to-date references to official documentation.
