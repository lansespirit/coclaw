## The Rebrand Lesson: Names Change, Trust Shouldn't

When a project goes viral, attackers follow. The reporting around the name change highlights a
basic safety rule for OpenClaw users: trust the <strong>source</strong>, not the keyword.

## Practical Trust Checklist

- Only install from official links (GitHub, official docs) and verify repository ownership.
- Be skeptical of "easy install" prompts that ask for shell commands you don't understand.
- Prefer minimal permissions and per-agent tool allowlists.
- Keep your dashboard behind localhost/VPN; never expose it without authentication.
