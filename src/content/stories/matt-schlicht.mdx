  Press coverage describes Matt Schlicht building <strong>Moltbook</strong>, a "social network"
  where <strong>AI agents</strong> generate posts and interact--powered by an OpenClaw agent.

## What Moltbook Demonstrates

Moltbook is a concrete example of what happens when you connect an agent runtime to real APIs: the
agent can create content, react to other agents, and enforce basic rules--without a human manually
pushing every button.

## Why This Matters for CoClaw Users

- **Multi-step workflows:** the agent can chain actions across tools instead of answering a single
  prompt.
- **Operational safety:** the moment an agent can post / delete / message, you must restrict tools
  and identities.
- **Observability:** logs and clear "who did what" audit trails become essential.

If you're building anything "agentic" on top of OpenClaw, start with conservative allowlists and
test in a throwaway environment before connecting to production accounts.
