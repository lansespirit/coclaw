<p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-8">
            In the age of LLMs, data is the new oil, and everyone wants a refill. When you use 100% cloud-based AI, you are often trading your deepest industrial secrets or personal thoughts for convenience. OpenClaw was built on a different premise: <strong>Your AI should be as private as your home.</strong>
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">The Self-Hosted Advantage</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">
            By running OpenClaw on your local machine, a dedicated VPS, or a private Docker cluster, you ensure that the "orchestration layer"--the part that knows which contacts you talk to and what your schedules are--never leaves your perimeter.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">End-to-End Encryption Channels</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">
            Our integrations for Signal and WhatsApp utilize the native encryption protocols. OpenClaw interacts with these messages locally on your host OS using sandboxed browser instances or terminal-based clients, ensuring that even the metadata remained protected from third-party interception.
