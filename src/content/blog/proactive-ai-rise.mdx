<p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-8">
            The era of the "waiting" chatbot is over. For the past five years, we've lived in a world where AI only speaks when spoken to. You ask a question, you get an answer. But as autonomous agents like OpenClaw mature, the paradigm is shifting from reactive to <strong>proactive assistance</strong>.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">What is Proactive AI?</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">
            Proactive AI doesn't wait for your terminal prompt. It monitors your configured channels, cross-references your calendar, and understands the context of your ongoing projects. When it detects a misalignment or an opportunity to save you time--like reminding you of a missing follow-up on Slack after a Telegram meeting--it acts.

            "The best AI assistants aren't just intelligent; they're attentive."

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">OpenClaw's Approach</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">
            Unlike centralized corporate bots, OpenClaw runs on your own infrastructure. This gives it "ambient awareness" without compromising your privacy. By running as a self-hosted control plane, OpenClaw can observe patterns in your communication through the WhatsApp Gateway or Discord plugins and suggest optimizations in real-time.

            <li><strong>Contextual Triggers:</strong> Event-driven workflows based on message sentiment or specific keywords.</li>
            <li><strong>Scheduled Autonomy:</strong> Agents that perform research and summarize news cycles at specific intervals.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Platform Knowledge:</strong> Seamlessly carrying context from a WhatsApp chat into a Jira ticket creation.</li>
          </ul>
