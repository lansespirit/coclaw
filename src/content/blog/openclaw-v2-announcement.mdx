<p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Open-source projects move fast. The safest way to upgrade OpenClaw is to treat every update as a change-management exercise: read the release notes, understand breaking changes, test in a throwaway environment, then upgrade your production setup.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Where to Find Authoritative Changes</h2>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 mb-8">
            <li><strong>GitHub Releases:</strong> the canonical place for versioned change logs.</li>
            <li><strong>Official Docs:</strong> updated installation and configuration guidance.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Reports:</strong> issues/discussions often reveal edge cases early.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">A Safe Upgrade Checklist</h2>

            <li>Back up your config and any stateful data.</li>
            <li>Upgrade Node.js if the runtime requirement changed.</li>
            <li>Upgrade OpenClaw and run a smoke test on a non-production machine.</li>
            <li>Re-validate channel integrations (tokens/webhooks) and your allowlists.</li>
