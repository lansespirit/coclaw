<p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Most real assistants fail for a boring reason: they become expensive, slow, or lose track of what matters as conversations grow. "Context efficiency" is about keeping the model informed <em>without</em> sending everything every time.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">The Three Levers</h2>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 mb-8">
            <li><strong>Reduce input:</strong> summarize, prune, and de-duplicate history.</li>
            <li><strong>Retrieve just-in-time:</strong> pull the right facts via search/RAG instead of replaying full chat logs.</li>
            <li><strong>Constrain output:</strong> ask for structured responses, limit verbosity, and use tool calls for long data.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">A Simple Strategy That Works</h2>
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 mb-8">
            <li>Keep a short "current goal + constraints" memory.</li>
            <li>Summarize after important milestones (not every message).</li>
            <li>Store durable facts in a notes system, not the prompt.</li>
            <li>When you need details, retrieve them (docs, files, tickets) on demand.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="mb-6">
            In practice, this means your agent stays helpful in weeks-long projects while keeping token usage predictable.
