## Symptoms

- Installer refuses to proceed because Node is too old.
- Running the gateway/CLI fails with errors that imply unsupported Node features.

## Cause

OpenClaw requires **Node.js 22+**. Many machines have an older system Node, or multiple Node installs (brew + nvm + system package manager). The gateway service may also run with a different PATH than your interactive shell.

## Fix

### 1) Check your current Node

```bash
node --version
```

If it’s below 22, upgrade.

### 2) Upgrade Node (pick one method)

- macOS: Homebrew (`brew install node`) or a version manager
- Linux: NodeSource or a version manager that can install Node 22
- Windows: official installer or `winget`

### 3) Confirm the service sees the right Node

After upgrading, open a new terminal and re-check:

```bash
node --version
openclaw --help
```

If the CLI uses Node 22 but the background service doesn’t, you likely have a PATH mismatch (launchd/systemd environment). Run:

```bash
openclaw doctor
```

## Verify

```bash
openclaw status
```
