## Symptoms

- Sending a Telegram voice note (audio-only) produces **no reply**.
- If you add any text (for example, `?` + voice note), the bot replies and the transcription works.

## Cause

Audio-only messages need a transcription step to produce a usable text prompt.
If inbound audio transcription is disabled (or blocked by limits/scope), the gateway may treat the message as “no text”, so it never triggers a normal reply flow.

## Fix

### 1) Enable inbound audio transcription (recommended)

In your config, enable `tools.media.audio` and pick a provider (or let auto-detection work).

Example (OpenAI transcription):

```json5
{
  tools: {
    media: {
      audio: {
        enabled: true,
        models: [{ provider: "openai", model: "gpt-4o-mini-transcribe" }],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Restart the gateway after changes.

### 2) Ensure media limits allow voice notes

- Telegram media cap: `channels.telegram.mediaMaxMb` (default 5MB)
- Audio transcription cap: `tools.media.audio.maxBytes` (default 20MB)

If your voice notes are larger than the Telegram cap, they may never be downloaded/transcribed.

### 3) Probe and check logs

On the gateway host:

```bash
openclaw channels status --probe
openclaw logs --follow
```

Look for audio transcription messages (or errors about media size/timeout/auth).

## Verify

- Send an audio-only voice note; the bot replies with the transcript-based answer.
- The logs show an audio transcription decision/output.
