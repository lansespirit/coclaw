## Symptoms

- Sending a message fails with: **`Error: No active WhatsApp Web listener`**
- `openclaw channels login` reports success, but WhatsApp still doesn't work.
- QR login may hang with **“Timed out waiting for WhatsApp QR”**.

## Cause

WhatsApp in OpenClaw requires an **active gateway process** holding a live WhatsApp Web socket.
If the gateway is stopped, crashed, or the WhatsApp socket failed to start, outbound sends fail fast.

Common causes:

- The gateway is not running (or restarted and never reconnected).
- WhatsApp credentials are logged out/corrupted.
- Unsupported runtime (WhatsApp requires Node; Bun is unsupported).

## Fix

### 1) Confirm the gateway is running

On the gateway host:

```bash
openclaw gateway status
openclaw channels status --probe
```

### 2) Restart the gateway (often enough)

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

Then re-check:

```bash
openclaw channels status --probe
```

### 3) If WhatsApp is logged out, re-link

```bash
openclaw channels logout
openclaw channels login
```

### 4) Ensure the gateway uses Node (not Bun)

If you previously installed/runs the gateway with Bun, run:

```bash
openclaw doctor
```

Then restart the gateway.

## Verify

- `openclaw channels status --probe` shows WhatsApp linked and active.
- Outbound sends succeed (no listener error).
