## Symptoms

- PowerShell shows:
  - `'openclaw' is not recognized as an internal or external command`
- You just installed OpenClaw, but the command isn't available.

## Cause

On Windows, global npm installs place executables into a global bin folder (commonly `%AppData%\\npm`).
If that folder is not on PATH (or you haven't restarted the terminal), `openclaw` won't be found.

## Fix

### 1) Restart PowerShell/Windows Terminal

Close all terminals and reopen one (PATH changes don't always apply to existing shells).

### 2) Find your npm global prefix

```powershell
npm config get prefix
```

Your global bin folder is usually `<prefix>\\bin` (or `%AppData%\\npm` depending on Node setup).

### 3) Add the global bin folder to PATH

Add it via Windows Environment Variables UI, then reopen the terminal.

## Verify

```powershell
where openclaw
openclaw --help
```
