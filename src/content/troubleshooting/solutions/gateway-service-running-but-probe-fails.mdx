## Symptoms

- `openclaw gateway status` says the service is running, but:
  - the Control UI won't connect, or
  - `openclaw status --deep` / `openclaw channels status --probe` can't reach the gateway.

## Cause

Most common causes:

- You're probing the **wrong gateway** (for example, your CLI is in remote mode, or using a different profile/state dir).
- The gateway process is running but **not listening** on the expected port (bind/auth mismatch, crash loop, refused bind).
- Firewall / network path prevents reachability from your client.

## Fix

### 1) Confirm what the CLI is trying to reach

Run:

```bash
openclaw gateway status
```

Pay attention to the printed probe target / URL and whether you’re in local vs remote mode.

### 2) Verify the gateway is actually listening

If the gateway is local to the machine you're on, try opening the Control UI locally:

- `http://127.0.0.1:18789/`

If that works but remote doesn’t, it’s almost always bind/firewall/auth.

### 3) Check for bind/auth mismatch

If you bind to LAN/tailnet, ensure auth is set (token/password). If you see “refusing to bind … without auth”, fix auth and restart.

### 4) Repair service/profile mismatches

If you changed install method (npm ↔ git), profile, or config location, rewrite the service:

```bash
openclaw gateway install --force
```

Then restart and re-probe.

## Verify

- `openclaw status --deep` succeeds.
- Control UI stays connected and `openclaw channels status --probe` works.
