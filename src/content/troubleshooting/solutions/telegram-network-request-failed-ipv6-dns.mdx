## Symptoms

- Gateway logs show errors like:
  - `HttpError: Network request for 'sendMessage' failed`
  - `HttpError: Network request for 'sendChatAction' failed`
- `setMyCommands` may also fail on startup.

## Cause

Most often:

- `api.telegram.org` resolves to IPv6 first, but your host has **no IPv6 egress**, or
- outbound DNS/HTTPS to `api.telegram.org` is blocked/restricted on the gateway host.

## Fix

### 1) Probe Telegram from OpenClaw

On the gateway host:

```bash
openclaw channels status --probe
```

If Telegram probes fail, continue below.

### 2) If your host does not support IPv6, force IPv4 (common on VPS)

Options (pick one that matches your environment):

- Enable IPv6 on the host/network, or
- Configure the host to prefer IPv4 / disable IPv6 DNS resolution for this environment.

Then restart the gateway.

### 3) If you're on a restricted network

Run the gateway on a host with reliable egress to Telegram (VPS), or use a network path that can reach `api.telegram.org`.

## Verify

- `openclaw channels status --probe` reports Telegram healthy.
- A test Telegram message triggers a response.
