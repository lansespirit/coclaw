## Symptoms

- In chat, `/model <something>` returns: `Model "provider/model" is not allowed`.
- It can feel like the bot “didn’t respond” because the selection fails before a normal reply.

## Cause

`agents.defaults.models` is configured as an **allowlist**. When it’s non-empty, only those models can be selected.

## Fix

Check the allowlist:

```bash
openclaw config get agents.defaults.models
```

Then do one of:

- Add the model you want to the allowlist (recommended for safety), or
- Clear/remove `agents.defaults.models` to disable allowlisting, or
- Pick a model that is already in the allowlist (`/model list`).

## Verify

- Re-run `/model list` and confirm the target model is selectable.
- Send a message; it uses the expected model.
