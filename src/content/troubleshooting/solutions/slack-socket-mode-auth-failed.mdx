## Symptoms

- Slack stays disconnected, or Slack events never arrive.
- Logs mention auth problems such as `invalid_auth` / `not_authed`.
- You’re using Socket Mode but messages never trigger the bot.

## Cause

Slack Socket Mode requires **two** tokens:

- App token: `xapp-...` (must include `connections:write`)
- Bot token: `xoxb-...`

Connection/auth fails when:

- One token is missing/wrong, or swapped (xapp vs xoxb).
- Socket Mode is not enabled in the Slack app.
- The app was not reinstalled after changing scopes/events.

## Fix

### 1) Validate you have both tokens configured

In `channels.slack` config (or env vars), ensure both are set:

- `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` = `xapp-...`
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` = `xoxb-...`

Restart the gateway after changes.

### 2) Recreate/reinstall tokens in Slack

In Slack Developer Portal:

1. Enable **Socket Mode**.
2. Create an App-Level Token with scope `connections:write` (xapp).
3. Install the app to your workspace to generate the Bot token (xoxb).

If you changed scopes/events, **reinstall** the app.

### 3) Invite the bot to the target channel(s)

Even with correct tokens, Slack won’t deliver channel messages unless the bot is in the channel.

## Verify

- `openclaw channels status --probe` shows Slack connected.
- Mentioning the bot or sending a DM triggers a response.
