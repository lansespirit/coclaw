## Symptoms

- WhatsApp chat shows an error reply like: **`[openclaw] 401 No cookie auth credentials found`**
- WhatsApp seems configured, but sending/receiving stops working.

## Cause

The gateway is not currently logged into WhatsApp Web (credentials are missing, expired, or corrupted).

In OpenClaw, the **gateway** owns the WhatsApp session files. If you ran login on a different machine, or the credential folder was deleted, the gateway cannot send/receive.

## Fix

### 1) Check WhatsApp status (fast signal)

On the gateway host:

```bash
openclaw channels status --probe
```

If it reports logged out / unlinked, re-link below.

### 2) Re-link WhatsApp (safe reset)

On the gateway host:

```bash
openclaw channels logout
openclaw channels login
```

Scan the QR code in WhatsApp (Linked Devices).

### 3) Confirm credentials exist where the gateway expects

WhatsApp credentials are stored under:

- `~/.openclaw/credentials/whatsapp/<accountId>/creds.json`

If you run multiple accounts, ensure you are logging in to the correct `--account <id>`.

## Verify

- `openclaw channels status --probe` shows WhatsApp linked/healthy.
- Sending a test WhatsApp message works normally.
