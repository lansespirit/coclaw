## Symptoms

- Slack DMs to the bot work, but messages in a channel never trigger a reply.
- Slack appears connected/healthy, but nothing happens in public/private channels.

## Cause

Most common causes:

- The bot/app is **not a member** of the target channel.
- Your config requires **mentions**, but you are not mentioning the bot.
- The Slack app is missing required **events/scopes** (or wasn’t reinstalled after changes).

## Fix

### 1) Invite the app to the channel

In Slack, invite the bot/app to the channel you want it to read.

### 2) Mention the bot (quick test)

Send a message that explicitly mentions the bot (this avoids “silent” configs that only activate on mentions).

### 3) Validate your Slack app configuration

In Slack Developer Portal:

- Ensure Events are enabled and include `app_mention` and `message.*` events.
- If you changed scopes/events, **reinstall** the app to the workspace.

Then restart the gateway.

## Verify

- Mentioning the bot in a channel produces a reply.
- `openclaw channels status --probe` shows Slack healthy.
