## Symptoms

- Gateway logs or the Control UI show an error like:
  - **“This version of Antigravity is no longer supported. Please update to receive the latest features!”**
- Requests routed through `google-antigravity/...` stop working (suddenly or after a long time).

## Cause

Antigravity is a hosted bridge and it can enforce minimum client versions. If your OpenClaw Docker image is older (or your gateway has cached older plugin/client code), Antigravity may refuse requests.

## Fix

### 1) Update OpenClaw in your Docker deployment

If you run from an OpenClaw repo checkout:

1. Pull the latest OpenClaw changes.
2. Rebuild the Docker image.
3. Restart the gateway container.

If you used `docker-setup.sh`, the simplest path is to rerun it from a fresh checkout (it rebuilds and restarts).

### 2) Re-authenticate if needed

Some updates require re-auth (or your token expired). After updating, rerun your provider auth flow (for example, via `openclaw onboard` on the gateway host/container).

### 3) Temporary workaround: switch providers/models

If you need to stay online while debugging:

- Switch the primary model away from `google-antigravity/...` to another configured provider, or
- Add a fallback model from a different provider.

## Verify

- A test message succeeds and gateway logs no longer show the Antigravity update warning.
- `openclaw models status --probe` succeeds for your configured model(s).
