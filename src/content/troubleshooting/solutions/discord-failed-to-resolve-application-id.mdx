## Symptoms

- Gateway startup logs include: **“Failed to resolve Discord application id”**.
- Discord channel never becomes healthy/connected.

## Cause

OpenClaw calls the Discord API (`discord.com/api/...`) on startup to discover your bot/application metadata.
This fails when:

- The bot token is missing/invalid, or
- The gateway host cannot reach Discord (DNS, firewall, network restrictions, geo-blocking).

## Fix

### 1) Verify your Discord bot token is set correctly

Make sure you configured the token in one place:

- Env: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...`, or
- Config: `channels.discord.token: "..."`.

Then restart the gateway.

### 2) Probe channel connectivity from OpenClaw

On the gateway host:

```bash
openclaw channels status --probe
```

If the probe fails for Discord, continue to the network checks below.

### 3) Check if the gateway host can reach Discord API

If you are on a restricted network (common on some ISPs/regions), the most reliable fix is:

- run the gateway on a VPS or machine that can reach Discord, or
- use a network path that can reach Discord (VPN / egress proxy at the OS level).

Then restart the gateway and re-run the probe.

## Verify

- `openclaw channels status --probe` reports Discord as reachable.
- The Discord channel connects and starts receiving messages.
