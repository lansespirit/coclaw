## Symptoms

- In the OpenClaw web chat UI, dragging an image file from your desktop into the input area opens the image in a **new browser tab** instead of uploading it.
- You may also see close code **1009** when pasting images (often size-related).

## Cause

This is typically a web UI drag-and-drop handler bug: the page doesn’t intercept the browser’s default “open the dropped file” behavior, so the drop navigates away instead of uploading.

## Fix

### 1) Use paste or the file picker (current workaround)

- Copy the image, then **paste** into the message box.
- If the UI has an attachment button / file picker, use that instead of drag-and-drop.

### 2) If paste fails with 1009, reduce image size

1009 is commonly triggered by payload limits.

Try one or more:

- Use a smaller image (resize / re-export to JPEG).
- Avoid very large screenshots; crop to the relevant region first.

### 3) Refresh the web UI after upgrading

If you recently upgraded OpenClaw, hard-reload the page to ensure you’re running the latest frontend assets:

- macOS: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

## Verify

- Send an image using paste or file picker; it should appear as an attachment and deliver successfully.
- Drag-and-drop should no longer open a new tab once the upstream UI fix is released.
