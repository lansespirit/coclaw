## Symptoms

- Proactive sends to a Signal group fail with **“Group not found”**.
- DMs work, and replying inside the group can still work, but scripted sends (CLI/tool/cron) to the group fail.

## Cause

Signal group IDs are base64 and **case-sensitive**.
Some versions or tooling can accidentally lowercase the group id, which breaks targeting.

## Fix

### 1) Copy the group id exactly (preserve casing)

When you store or paste a group id, keep it exactly as provided by OpenClaw / signal-cli (do not lowercase it).

### 2) Prefer replying in-thread while you recover

If you can still reply to a message inside the group, do that first (the session already knows the correct group id).

### 3) Upgrade OpenClaw if you suspect an old normalization bug

If your version lowercases group IDs, upgrade OpenClaw to the latest version and restart the gateway.

## Verify

- A test send to `signal:group:<groupId>` succeeds.
- The group receives the message.
