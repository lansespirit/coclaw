## Symptoms

- Discord channel shows connected, but the bot never replies in guild channels.
- Logs show **“Used disallowed intents”** (or similar intent-related errors).

## Cause

Discord blocks “privileged intents” unless you explicitly enable them in the Developer Portal.
Without these intents, your bot may connect but won’t receive the message events OpenClaw needs.

## Fix

### 1) Enable privileged intents in the Discord Developer Portal

In your Discord application:

- Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents → enable:
  - **Message Content Intent** (required for most guild message text)
  - **Server Members Intent** (recommended; required for some lookups/allowlist matching)

### 2) Restart the gateway

After changing intents, restart OpenClaw so it reconnects with the new permissions.

### 3) Verify guild/channel access rules

If your config requires mentions or uses allowlists, make sure:

- you are mentioning the bot, and/or
- your user/channel is allowed in `channels.discord.guilds`.

## Verify

- Mention the bot in a channel it can read; it replies.
- `openclaw channels status --probe` shows Discord healthy.
