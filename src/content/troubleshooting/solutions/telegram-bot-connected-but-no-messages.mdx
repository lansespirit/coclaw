## Symptoms

- Telegram token is configured and the gateway reports Telegram as started/connected.
- But the bot never receives messages (DM or group), even though Telegram shows them delivered.

## Cause

Common causes:

- Telegram **privacy mode** prevents group messages unless the bot is mentioned (depends on how you use it).
- A **webhook/polling conflict** (another bot framework/webhook is registered for the same token).
- Network/DNS restrictions prevent long-polling from working reliably on the gateway host.

## Fix

### 1) Probe channel status from the gateway

On the gateway host:

```bash
openclaw channels status --probe
```

### 2) Check group behavior (mentions/privacy mode)

In groups, try mentioning the bot explicitly.

If you need the bot to react without mentions, adjust your group activation/rules (and consider allowlists to avoid spam).

### 3) Ensure the token is not used elsewhere

If you previously used the same bot token with another framework that set a webhook, remove it (or create a new bot token dedicated to OpenClaw).

### 4) If you're on a restricted network

Run the gateway on a host that can reliably reach Telegram (VPS), or use an egress path that allows Telegram connections, then restart the gateway.

## Verify

- Sending a DM triggers a response.
- In a group, mentioning the bot triggers a response (and your desired activation mode works).
