## Symptoms

- Docker logs show errors like:
  - `EACCES: permission denied, open '/home/node/.openclaw/openclaw.json.<...>.tmp'`
- The gateway starts but can't save config, auth profiles, or sessions.

## Cause

The official Docker image runs as a non-root `node` user (uid **1000**) for safety.
When you bind-mount your host `~/.openclaw` into `/home/node/.openclaw`, the container user must have write permissions.

This fails most often on Linux when:

- your host user is **not** uid 1000, and the directory is only writable by your host uid, or
- the directory/file is owned by root from a previous run.

## Fix

### 1) Confirm which host directories are mounted

If you used `docker-setup.sh`, it typically mounts:

- `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR` → `/home/node/.openclaw`
- `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR` → `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace`

### 2) Linux: make the mount writable by uid 1000 (quickest)

On the host:

```bash
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 "${OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.openclaw}"
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 "${OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR:-$HOME/.openclaw/workspace}"
```

Then restart the containers:

```bash
docker compose restart
```

### 3) Alternative: run the container as your host user (advanced)

If you prefer matching the host uid/gid instead of changing ownership, set the compose `user:` to your uid/gid (security trade-offs vary by host).

Example (`docker-compose.override.yml`):

```yaml
services:
  openclaw-gateway:
    user: "${UID}:${GID}"
  openclaw-cli:
    user: "${UID}:${GID}"
```

## Verify

- Restarted gateway can write config (no new `EACCES` lines in `docker compose logs`).
- Control UI can save settings and the gateway persists sessions under the mounted directory.
