## Symptoms

- Gateway startup fails with `EADDRINUSE`.
- You see `GatewayLockError("another gateway instance is already listening on ws://127.0.0.1:18789")`.

## Cause

The gateway enforces single-instance by binding its WebSocket/HTTP port early. If something already uses the port (another gateway instance or any other process), startup fails.

## Fix

### Option A: Stop the other gateway instance

Run:

```bash
openclaw gateway status
```

If you have multiple installs (e.g. macOS app + CLI), stop the one you don’t want running.

### Option B: Use a different port

```bash
openclaw gateway --port 18790
```

For a permanent change, set `gateway.port` in your config (or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT`).

### Option C: If you actually need multiple gateways

Only do this when you need real isolation/redundancy. You must isolate:

- config path
- state dir / profile
- gateway port

## Verify

```bash
openclaw status
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` (and use `openclaw dashboard` for the tokenized link if needed).
