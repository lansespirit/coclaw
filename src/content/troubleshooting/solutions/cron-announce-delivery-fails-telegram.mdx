## Symptoms

- Your cron jobs execute normally (facts extraction, summaries, etc.).
- But jobs configured with delivery **announce** to Telegram do not arrive.
- You may see an error state like `cron announce delivery failed` in cron run status / UI.
- Manual Telegram messaging still works (for example via the `message` tool or direct Bot API tests).

## Cause

OpenClaw cron has multiple output paths:

- `delivery.mode = "announce"`: cron delivers the run's outbound payloads directly via the channel adapters.
- `delivery.mode = "none"`: cron does **not** deliver; you can send messages yourself inside the run.
- `delivery.mode = "webhook"`: cron posts the finished event to your endpoint.

When only `announce` fails, it usually indicates a problem in the announce delivery pipeline (target parsing/routing, channel adapter send, or a regression in the cron announce path), not a general Telegram connectivity problem.

## Fix

### 1) Fastest workaround: turn off announce and send via `message` inside the job

Edit the job to disable announce:

```bash
openclaw cron edit <job-id> --no-deliver
```

Then update your cron prompt to send the message explicitly (example idea):

- Generate the content
- Call `message.send` to your Telegram target

Why this helps: docs note that `announce` delivery **suppresses messaging tool sends** for the run. With `delivery.mode = "none"`, you regain full control of outbound messages.

### 2) If you want delivery without chat adapters: use webhook mode

If you have an HTTP endpoint that forwards to Telegram (or logs results), switch the job:

```bash
openclaw cron edit <job-id> --webhook --to "https://example.com/openclaw/cron"
```

### 3) Capture the failing announce error from gateway logs

On the gateway host:

```bash
openclaw logs --follow | rg -i "cron|announce|telegram|deliver|sendMessage|error"
```

And verify Telegram is configured and probe-able:

```bash
openclaw channels status --probe telegram
```

If you can paste the announce-related error lines (redacting tokens), it will usually show whether this is a target parsing issue or an adapter send failure.

## Verify

- Wait for the next scheduled run
- Confirm one of:
  - The job delivers via your explicit `message.send` path (with `--no-deliver`), or
  - The webhook endpoint receives the payload (with `delivery.mode = "webhook"`)
