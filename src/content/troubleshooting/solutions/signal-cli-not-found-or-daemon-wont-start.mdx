## Symptoms

- Signal channel fails to start.
- Logs indicate `signal-cli` is missing, not executable, or the daemon never becomes ready.

## Cause

OpenClaw's Signal integration depends on **signal-cli** (and a working Java runtime).
If `signal-cli` is not installed, not on PATH, or is slow to start, the gateway cannot connect to the Signal daemon.

## Fix

### 1) Install signal-cli (and Java) on the gateway host

Install signal-cli using your OS package manager or the official distribution for your platform, and ensure Java is available.

### 2) Point OpenClaw at the correct cli path

Set `channels.signal.cliPath` if `signal-cli` isn’t on PATH:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    signal: {
      cliPath: "/full/path/to/signal-cli",
    },
  },
}
```

Restart the gateway.

### 3) If startup is slow, increase timeout or use an external daemon

Option A: increase `channels.signal.startupTimeoutMs`.

Option B (recommended on slow machines): run the daemon yourself and set `channels.signal.httpUrl`, disabling autostart:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    signal: {
      httpUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
      autoStart: false,
    },
  },
}
```

## Verify

- `openclaw channels status --probe` shows Signal healthy.
- Sending a DM to the Signal bot number triggers a reply.
