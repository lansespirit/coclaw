## Symptoms

- The gateway works while the terminal is open, but stops when you exit (or after SSH disconnects).
- `systemctl --user status openclaw-gateway.service` says the unit does not exist.
- `openclaw gateway status` shows not running after reboot.

## Cause

The gateway is running in the foreground, but the systemd (user) service was not installed/enabled (or it points at an old OpenClaw install path).

## Fix

### 1) Install (or reinstall) the gateway service

On the gateway host:

```bash
openclaw gateway install
```

If you recently switched install methods (npm ↔ git) or profiles, force a rewrite:

```bash
openclaw gateway install --force
```

### 2) Check the service status

```bash
systemctl --user status openclaw-gateway.service
```

Restart if needed:

```bash
systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway.service
```

### 3) Keep the gateway running after logout (recommended on servers)

Enable systemd user lingering:

```bash
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

## Verify

- `openclaw gateway status` shows running.
- After logging out and back in (or after reboot), the gateway is still running.
