## Symptoms

- A cron job looks enabled and has a valid `nextRunAtMs`, but it **never executes**.
- At the scheduled time:
  - no logs appear for the run,
  - `openclaw cron runs --id <job-id>` stays empty,
  - and `nextRunAtMs` **advances** to the next occurrence anyway (as if it ran).

## Cause

This is usually caused by a **Gateway cron scheduler regression** in some OpenClaw versions where maintenance logic can advance a past-due `nextRunAtMs` without executing the run.

It can also be caused by mismatched assumptions around timezones (host timezone vs explicit `tz`).

## Fix

### 1) Upgrade OpenClaw and restart the gateway

Upgrade to the latest OpenClaw (or at least a version that includes the cron scheduler fixes), then restart:

```bash
openclaw --version

# npm global install
npm update -g openclaw

openclaw gateway restart
```

### 2) Verify cron storage + job state

List jobs and confirm the scheduler sees it as enabled with a future `nextRunAtMs`:

```bash
openclaw cron list
openclaw cron runs --id <job-id>
```

If the job is supposed to run at a specific wall-clock time, set an explicit timezone:

```bash
openclaw cron edit <job-id> --tz "America/Los_Angeles"
```

## Verify

- Wait for the next scheduled time and confirm the job appears in:
  - `openclaw cron runs --id <job-id>`
- If it is a main-session job, confirm the system event is delivered.
- If it is an isolated job, confirm it produces an isolated run and (if enabled) delivery happens.
