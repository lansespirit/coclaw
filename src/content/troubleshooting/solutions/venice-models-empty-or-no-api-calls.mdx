## Symptoms

- You select a `venice/...` model but responses are empty, fail quickly, or appear to do nothing.
- `openclaw models list` doesn't show expected Venice models.
- Logs mention missing Venice credentials or Venice API unreachable.

## Cause

Common causes:

- `VENICE_API_KEY` is missing on the **gateway host** (not just your laptop).
- The gateway can't reach `https://api.venice.ai/api/v1` (DNS/firewall/restricted network).
- The model ref is wrong or no longer available in the Venice catalog.
- Venice credits are exhausted or billing blocks the request.

## Fix

### 1) Confirm Venice is configured on the gateway host

Run:

```bash
openclaw models status
```

If Venice isn't authenticated/configured, set `VENICE_API_KEY` on the gateway host and restart the gateway.

### 2) Refresh model catalog and verify model refs

```bash
openclaw models list
```

Pick a model that exists in the list and set it explicitly:

```bash
openclaw models set venice/<modelId>
```

### 3) Probe with a real request

```bash
openclaw models status --probe
```

If probes fail, it's almost always credentials, reachability, or billing.

### 4) Add a fallback model (recommended)

If Venice is temporarily down or rate-limited, add a fallback from another provider so users aren't blocked.

## Verify

- `openclaw models status --probe` succeeds for the Venice model.
- A test message returns a normal response and logs show a successful provider call.
