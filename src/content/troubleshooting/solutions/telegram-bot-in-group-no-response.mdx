## Symptoms

- The bot is added to a Telegram group, but never replies.
- It replies in DMs, but not in groups.
- It only replies when you mention it (or not even then).

## Cause

Common causes fall into two buckets:

### A) Telegram-side

- Telegram privacy mode is ON (bot only receives mentions), or
- the bot is not an admin (so it can’t see all messages depending on group settings).

### B) OpenClaw-side configuration

- You configured `channels.telegram.groups` as an allowlist but did not include the current group id (and didn’t include `"*"`).
- The group is configured with `requireMention: true` and you are not mentioning the bot.

## Fix

### 1) Quick test: mention the bot

In the group:

- `@your_bot hello`

If it only replies to mentions, you’re in mention-only mode (either Telegram privacy mode or `requireMention`).

### 2) Confirm allowlist/group id

Find the group chat id safely by checking gateway logs:

```bash
openclaw logs --follow
```

Look for `chat.id` after sending a message in the group.

Then configure:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      groups: {
        "-1001234567890": { requireMention: false }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Important: once you set `channels.telegram.groups`, it becomes an **allowlist**. If you want to allow all groups:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      groups: {
        "*": { requireMention: false }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3) Fix Telegram privacy mode / permissions

If you need the bot to receive non-mention messages:

- disable privacy mode in BotFather (and re-add bot), or
- grant the bot admin rights (depending on group requirements).

## Verify

- Send a non-mention message; bot replies (if configured).
- `openclaw channels status --probe` shows Telegram healthy.
