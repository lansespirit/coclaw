## Symptoms

- `openclaw onboard` finishes, but you were never asked to pick a model provider or enter an API key.
- OpenClaw defaults to `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6`, but the agent never responds (TUI/WebChat shows "loading" indefinitely).
- Re-running `openclaw onboard` does not bring back the missing Model/Auth step.

## Cause

The onboarding wizard can be broken in some releases and skip the Model/Auth step entirely. When that happens, OpenClaw may default to a provider/model that requires credentials, but no credentials were configured, so the agent cannot complete requests.

## Fix

### 1) Configure a provider API key after onboarding (fastest)

If you're using Anthropic:

```bash
openclaw config set env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY "sk-ant-..."
openclaw gateway restart
```

If you're using OpenAI instead, set `env.OPENAI_API_KEY` (or configure it via `openclaw configure`) and restart the gateway.

### 2) Run the interactive configurator

```bash
openclaw configure
openclaw gateway restart
```

### 3) Downgrade and re-run onboarding (workaround)

If you need the wizard flow to work end-to-end, install a known-good version, then rerun onboarding:

```bash
npm uninstall -g openclaw
npm install -g openclaw@2026.2.9
openclaw onboard
```

## Verify

- Send a message in TUI/WebChat; the agent responds normally.
- Optional: `openclaw models status --probe` succeeds for your configured provider.
