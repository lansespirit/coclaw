## Symptoms

- `npx clawhub@latest auth login --token ...` fails with **Unauthorized**, even when the token was just generated.
- The token looks like `clh_...`.
- CLI actions that require auth (for example deleting a skill) fail due to the login not sticking.

## Cause

Some CLI versions default to a registry/base URL that causes token auth to fail. Pointing the CLI at the `www` registry URL works around the issue.

## Fix

### 1) Login with the www registry URL

```bash
npx clawhub@latest auth login \\
  --token "clh_..." \\
  --no-browser \\
  --registry "https://www.clawhub.ai/"
```

If you're using a globally installed `clawhub` binary instead of `npx`, pass the same `--registry` flag.

### 2) Retry the command that originally failed

For example, retry the delete/install action after a successful login.

## Verify

- The login command completes without **Unauthorized**.
- Your original CLI action (for example deleting the skill) succeeds.
