## Symptoms

- You linked WhatsApp successfully, but when you message from your own personal account, the bot doesn’t respond.
- You are running OpenClaw on the same number you normally use.

## Cause

Running a bot on your **personal** WhatsApp number is a supported fallback, but it needs extra configuration so OpenClaw can distinguish “self-chat” testing from normal DMs and avoid loop/spam behaviors.

## Fix

### 1) Enable self-chat mode for personal-number setups

In your config:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      selfChatMode: true,
    },
  },
}
```

### 2) Test using “Message yourself”

In WhatsApp, use the built-in “Message yourself” chat for testing (recommended) so you don’t accidentally spam contacts during setup.

### 3) Ensure DM policy allows your number

If you use allowlists, add your own E.164 number to `channels.whatsapp.allowFrom`.

## Verify

- Sending a message in “Message yourself” triggers a reply.
- `openclaw channels status --probe` shows WhatsApp healthy.
