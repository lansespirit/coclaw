## Symptoms

- You have an isolated cron job that generates a multi-line report.
- After an upgrade, `delivery.mode = "announce"` delivers only a short summary (or noisy relay) instead of the full report output.
- This is especially common when delivering to Telegram forum topics (threads).

## Cause

Some OpenClaw versions/regressions have produced incorrect announce behavior for isolated cron runs:

- the delivery path summarizes output rather than forwarding the full outbound payloads, and/or
- the output is surfaced in an unexpected place (for example Control UI chat history) rather than the intended channel target.

## Fix

### 1) Most reliable: disable announce and send the full report yourself

Turn off announce delivery:

```bash
openclaw cron edit <job-id> --no-deliver
```

Then change the job prompt so it explicitly calls the message tool to send the report.

For Telegram forum topics, prefer sending to the group id plus a `messageThreadId` (topic id).

### 2) If you need a fast operational workaround: pin a known-good version

If you know a previous version delivered correctly in your environment, pin to it temporarily (many reports cite older 2026.2.x builds as working for this path), then restart the gateway.

### 3) If you're on a newer build: avoid Telegram topic delivery while you verify

As a temporary measure, deliver to a DM or a non-topic group target (no thread id) to confirm the job output itself is correct, then move back to topic delivery once the regression is fixed.

## Verify

- Trigger a run:
  - `openclaw cron run <job-id>`
- Confirm the full report is delivered (not summarized), and only once.
