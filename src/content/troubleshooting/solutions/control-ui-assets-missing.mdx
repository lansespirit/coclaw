## Symptoms

- Logs say “Control UI assets not found”.
- The UI doesn’t load, or certain UI pages 404.

## Cause

The gateway can run without UI assets, but the web UI needs a built `dist/control-ui/` bundle. In slim/docker-like environments, UI source files may not even be present, so auto-building is skipped.

## Fix

### Option A: Let doctor guide the fix (recommended)

```bash
openclaw doctor
```

If it offers to build UI assets, accept.

### Option B: Build UI assets manually (source checkout)

From the OpenClaw repo root:

```bash
pnpm ui:build
```

Then restart the gateway (or rerun onboarding if you’re in the wizard flow).

## Verify

- Re-open the dashboard/control UI and confirm pages load.
- `openclaw status --deep` succeeds.
