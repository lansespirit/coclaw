## Symptoms

- The Discord bot appears online, but it never replies in a server channel.
- DMs may work, but guild channels are silent.

## Cause

Usually one of:

- The bot is missing channel permissions (View Channel / Send Messages / Read Message History).
- The bot is not actually in that channel/server (or can’t see the channel).
- Your config requires mentions, but you’re not mentioning the bot.
- Message Content Intent is disabled (see the dedicated intents solution if you see “Used disallowed intents”).

## Fix

### 1) Confirm OpenClaw sees Discord as healthy

On the gateway host:

```bash
openclaw channels status --probe
```

### 2) Verify bot permissions in the target channel

In Discord, ensure the bot role has at least:

- View Channel
- Send Messages
- Read Message History

If you’re using private channels, explicitly grant access.

### 3) Mention the bot (quick sanity test)

In a guild channel, send a message that mentions the bot (`@YourBot hello`).

If replies only work when mentioned, adjust your config to allow always-on replies in that channel (or keep mention-only to avoid spam).

### 4) If you use allowlists, confirm your user/channel is allowed

If `channels.discord.guilds` is configured, any channel/user not allowed there can be silently ignored.

## Verify

- Mentioning the bot in the channel triggers a reply.
- `openclaw channels status --probe` shows Discord healthy.
