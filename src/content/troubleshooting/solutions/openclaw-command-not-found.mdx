## Symptoms

- You installed OpenClaw, but your shell says `openclaw: command not found`.

## Cause

Almost always a Node/npm PATH problem:

- npm global bin directory is not on PATH
- you’re in a different shell than you configured (`zsh` vs `bash`)
- multiple Node installs exist and the service/terminal is using a different PATH

## Fix

### 1) Confirm where npm installs global binaries

```bash
npm prefix -g
```

Your global bin directory is typically `<prefix>/bin`. Ensure it’s on PATH.

### 2) Add it to your shell

Example:

```bash
export PATH="/path/from/npm/prefix/bin:$PATH"
```

Persist in:

- zsh: `~/.zshrc`
- bash: `~/.bashrc`

Then open a new terminal.

### 3) Recheck

```bash
command -v openclaw
openclaw --help
```

## Verify

`openclaw --help` prints usage, and `openclaw status` runs (even if gateway isn’t configured yet).
