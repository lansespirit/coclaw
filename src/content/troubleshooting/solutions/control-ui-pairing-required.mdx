## Symptoms

- The Control UI connects, then shows: **“disconnected (1008): pairing required”**.
- You can open the page (`http://<host>:18789/`), but the WebSocket disconnects immediately.
- This often happens when opening the UI from a different machine (LAN/tailnet) or via a reverse proxy.

## Cause

OpenClaw requires a **one-time device pairing approval** the first time a new browser/device connects to the gateway.

Common triggers:

- You are connecting remotely (LAN/tailnet/VPS/Docker host).
- You switched browsers, used a new browser profile, or cleared browser storage (new device id).
- You are using plain HTTP on a remote host and the browser blocks WebCrypto (pairing identity can’t be established).

## Fix

### 1) Approve the pending device request

On the **gateway host**, list pending requests:

```bash
openclaw devices list
```

Approve the request:

```bash
openclaw devices approve <requestId>
```

Then reload the Control UI page and reconnect.

### 2) If you’re remote, prefer a secure access path

Recommended options:

- Use an SSH tunnel and open locally:
  - `ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@host`
  - Open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/`
- Or expose the UI via HTTPS (for example, Tailscale Serve).

### 3) If you must use plain HTTP remotely

If you’re on a trusted network and understand the trade-offs, you can allow insecure auth for the Control UI and rely on token-only auth. See the Control UI docs linked above for the exact config option.

## Verify

- The Control UI stays connected (no immediate 1008 disconnect).
- `openclaw devices list` shows your browser/device as approved.

## Related

- If the UI says “unauthorized” (not pairing), use the dedicated auth solution page.
