## Symptoms

- The Control UI says **"unauthorized"**, or it connects then immediately disconnects / reconnects.
- You open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/` and see **unauthorized**.
- You see close code **1008**.

## Cause

The gateway has auth enabled (`gateway.auth.*`), but the browser UI is not sending the **same token/password** that the gateway expects.

Common causes:

- You opened the UI without the one-time `?token=...` link.
- Your browser cached an old token in localStorage.
- Your gateway token is being overridden by an environment variable (e.g. `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`).
- You are connecting to a remote host without an SSH tunnel / tailnet bind, so you are not actually reaching the gateway you think you are.

## Fix

### 1) Get a fresh tokenized link (fastest)

```bash
openclaw dashboard
```

Open the URL it prints (it should include `?token=...`).

### 2) Verify the gateway is reachable

```bash
openclaw status
```

If the gateway is remote, tunnel it first:

```bash
ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@host
```

Then open:

- `http://127.0.0.1:18789/?token=...`

### 3) Ensure gateway token matches what UI uses

- The gateway token source is `gateway.auth.token` (or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`).
- In the Control UI settings, paste the exact same token.

If you suspect an env override, run:

```bash
openclaw doctor
```

Look for notes about launchd/systemd environment overrides.

## Verify

- Reload the Control UI; it should stay connected.
- `openclaw status --deep` succeeds.
