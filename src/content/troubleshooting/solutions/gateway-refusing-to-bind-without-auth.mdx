## Symptoms

- Gateway immediately exits and logs show:
  - `refusing to bind gateway to <host>:18789 without auth (...)`
- `openclaw gateway status` shows the service restarting/crashing.

## Cause

When the gateway binds to a non-loopback interface (LAN/tailnet/custom), OpenClaw requires auth to be configured (token or password). This prevents exposing an unauthenticated gateway on the network.

## Fix

### 1) Set gateway auth (token or password)

Simplest: token auth.

- Set `gateway.auth.mode` to `token`
- Set `gateway.auth.token` (or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`)

Then restart the gateway.

### 2) Or bind only to loopback (local-only)

If you do not need LAN access, bind to loopback (127.0.0.1) and use SSH tunnel / local access.

## Verify

- `openclaw gateway status` shows running.
- You can open the Control UI and it stays connected.
