## Symptoms

- On Windows you installed OpenClaw inside WSL2, but `openclaw onboard --install-daemon` (or `openclaw gateway install`) fails.
- systemd user services aren’t available.

## Cause

OpenClaw recommends Windows usage via **WSL2**, and gateway daemon install relies on **systemd** inside the WSL distro. systemd is not enabled by default on some installs.

## Fix

Inside WSL:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/wsl.conf >/dev/null <<'EOF'
[boot]
systemd=true
EOF
```

Then from Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
```

Re-open your WSL distro and verify:

```bash
systemctl --user status
```

Now retry:

```bash
openclaw gateway install
# or
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

## Verify

```bash
openclaw gateway status
openclaw status
```
