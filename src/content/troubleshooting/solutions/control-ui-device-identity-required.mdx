## Symptoms

- Control UI disconnects with:
  - **“disconnected (1008): device identity required”**
- This commonly happens when you open the dashboard via:
  - `http://<lan-ip>:18789/`
  - `http://<tailscale-ip>:18789/`

## Cause

On remote **plain HTTP**, many browsers run in a non-secure context and block WebCrypto.
OpenClaw uses WebCrypto to establish device identity for Control UI auth/pairing, so the gateway rejects the connection.

## Fix

### 1) Prefer HTTPS (recommended)

Expose the Control UI via HTTPS (for example, using Tailscale Serve), then open the HTTPS URL.

### 2) Or open locally via an SSH tunnel

Tunnel the port and open the UI locally:

```bash
ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@host
```

Then open:

- `http://127.0.0.1:18789/`

### 3) If you must use HTTP remotely (advanced)

You can allow insecure auth for the Control UI and rely on token auth (security trade-offs). See the Control UI docs linked above for the exact config option.

## Verify

- The Control UI connects and stays connected.
- The disconnect message no longer appears.
