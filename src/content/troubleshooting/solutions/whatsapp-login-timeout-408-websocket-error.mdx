## Symptoms

- `openclaw channels login` waits, then fails with something like:
  - `WhatsApp Web connection ended before fully opening. status=408 Request Time-out WebSocket Error ()`
- You can open `https://web.whatsapp.com` in a browser, but OpenClaw login still times out.

## Cause

WhatsApp login uses a long-lived WhatsApp Web connection. It can fail when:

- Your network blocks WhatsApp WebSocket traffic.
- You are behind a proxy/VPN that does not support WebSockets reliably.
- You are running the login command on a different machine than the gateway (or the gateway’s environment does not have the same proxy settings).

## Fix

### 1) Run login on the gateway host (recommended)

Run `openclaw channels login` on the same machine that runs the gateway.

If your gateway runs on a VPS/Docker/WSL2, run the login there (that’s where the WhatsApp session is created and stored).

### 2) If you use a proxy, ensure it supports WebSockets and is applied to the gateway

- Make sure your proxy supports **WebSocket** connections.
- If the gateway runs as a background service, set proxy environment variables in `~/.openclaw/.env` on the gateway host and restart the gateway (setting it only in your interactive shell may not affect the service).

### 3) If you’re on a restricted network

Fastest workaround:

- Run the gateway on a host that can reach WhatsApp (for example, a VPS), or
- Use a VPN/egress path that allows WhatsApp Web connections.

## Verify

- `openclaw channels login` shows a QR and completes successfully.
- `openclaw channels status --probe` reports WhatsApp linked/healthy.
