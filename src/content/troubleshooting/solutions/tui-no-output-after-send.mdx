## Symptoms

- After you send a message in `openclaw tui`, the assistant reply is blank or shows **“(no output)”**.
- The UI looks idle, but you never get a response.
- This can be intermittent or only happen with certain models/providers.

## Cause

Most common causes:

- The TUI is connected, but the gateway run failed (provider auth, rate limit, model mismatch).
- The gateway is still busy, stalled, or disconnected.
- Delivery is off (you expected a reply in a chat channel, but the TUI is only showing local chat).
- A provider streaming edge case (some providers/models have had TUI rendering bugs).

## Fix

### 1) Confirm the TUI is connected and the run state is sane

In the TUI:

- Run `/status`
- If it shows disconnected, reconnect with the correct `--url/--token/--password`.

### 2) Check gateway logs (most actionable)

On the gateway host:

```bash
openclaw logs --follow
```

If you see auth or model errors, fix those first (then retry).

### 3) Sanity-check model/auth

On the gateway host:

```bash
openclaw models status
openclaw models status --probe
```

### 4) If you expected messages to be delivered to a channel

Turn on delivery:

- `/deliver on` (or start with `openclaw tui --deliver`)

### 5) Reset the session / restart the TUI

In the TUI:

- `/reset` (new clean session), or
- exit and rerun `openclaw tui`.

If the issue only happens with one provider/model, switch models temporarily and update OpenClaw to the latest version.

## Verify

- A new message returns a normal assistant response in the TUI.
- Gateway logs show a successful model call.
