## Symptoms

- Opening the Control UI via a LAN/IP URL (for example, `http://<gateway-ip>:18789/`) shows **Connected** on the overview, but other pages show:
  - `Error: missing scope: operator.read`
- Opening the same gateway via `http://127.0.0.1:18789/` works normally.
- This often starts after upgrading OpenClaw (for example, to `2026.2.14`).

## Cause

In some versions, the Control UI's auth/scope check can break when the UI is accessed via a non-loopback origin (LAN/IP), even though the gateway is reachable and otherwise healthy. The UI then fails RBAC checks and reports a missing `operator.read` scope.

## Fix

### 1) Use the loopback URL (recommended)

Open the UI using the tokenized link from:

```bash
openclaw dashboard
```

If the gateway is on another machine, tunnel it and use the loopback URL locally:

```bash
ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@host
```

Then open:

- `http://127.0.0.1:18789/?token=...`

### 2) Downgrade to a known-good version (workaround)

If this started after upgrading and you need LAN/IP access immediately, downgrade OpenClaw and restart the gateway.

For npm installs:

```bash
npm install -g openclaw@2026.2.13
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Verify

- Open the Control UI and navigate to pages that previously failed (for example, Operators / Sessions / Settings).
- The UI loads data without `missing scope: operator.read`.
