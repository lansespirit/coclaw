## What users report

```
## Summary
What went wrong?
The Matrix plugin does not work.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Install the Matrix plugin as described as the docs
2. Run `MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN=[...] MATRIX_HOMESERVER=https://[...] openclaw gateway`
3. Observe the logs being spammed with a warning and more importantly this:
```
08:41:52 [gateway] [plugins] failed to load plugin: Error: Cannot find module '@vector-im/matrix-bot-sdk'
Require stack:
- /home/nyx/.openclaw/extensions/matrix/src/matrix/client/config.ts (plugin=matrix, source=/home/nyx/.openclaw/extensions/matrix/index.ts)
```

## Expected behavior
What did you expect to happen?
Matrix plugin to work properly

## Actual behavior
What actually happened?
Does not connect to matrix (the admin api says it has no devices)

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: `2026.1.29`
- OS: Arch Linux
- Install method (pnpm/npx/docker/etc): `npm`

## Logs or screenshots
Paste relevant logs or add screenshots (redact secrets).
```
Config warnings:\n- plugins.entries.matrix: plugin matrix: duplicate plugin id detected; later plugin may be overridden (/usr/lib/node_modules/openclaw/extensions/matrix/index.ts)
Config warnings:\n- plugins.entries.matrix: plugin matrix: dupli
```

## Next diagnostic steps (recommended)
1. Confirm your OpenClaw version and Node.js version.
2. Capture gateway logs around the failure.
3. Check network/DNS reachability for any external APIs involved.
4. Compare your config with known-good examples in our Guides.
