## Summary
Audio-only voice messages sent via Telegram do not trigger the Clawdbot agent to process or respond. The agent only responds when text content is present alongside the audio file.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Send a voice message (audio-only .ogg file) via Telegram to Clawdbot
2. Wait for agent response
3. Observe: No response from agent
4. Send the same audio file with text (e.g., "?" + voice message)
5. Observe: Agent responds immediately with transcription and answer

## Expected behavior
The agent should automatically detect voice message attachments and:
1. Trigger Whisper transcription
2. Process the transcribed text
3. Generate and send a response

This should work the same as text-only messages or mixed media messages.

## Actual behavior
- Voice-only messages are received but ignored by the agent
- No transcription attempt is made
- No response is sent to the user
- The message appears in logs/history but doesn't trigger message handler
- Only when text accompanies the audio does the agent process it

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-2
- OS: Linux 6.8.0-90-generic (x64)
- Install method: Clawdbot Gateway (Tailscale bound)
- Channel: Telegram
- Skill: op
```

## Next diagnostic steps (recommended)
1. Confirm your OpenClaw version and Node.js version.
2. Capture gateway logs around the failure.
3. Check network/DNS reachability for any external APIs involved.
4. Compare your config with known-good examples in our Guides.
