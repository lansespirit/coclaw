## What users report

```
## Description
The `diagnostics-otel` plugin fails to load with:
```
plugin service failed (diagnostics-otel): TypeError: _resources.Resource is not a constructor
```

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Enable the plugin:
```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "allow": ["diagnostics-otel"],
    "entries": { "diagnostics-otel": { "enabled": true } }
  },
  "diagnostics": {
    "enabled": true,
    "otel": {
      "enabled": true,
      "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:4318"
    }
  }
}
```
2. Restart gateway
3. Check logs: `cat /tmp/clawdbot/clawdbot-*.log | grep otel`

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- Node: v25.4.0
- OS: macOS 15.6 (arm64)

## Expected
Plugin loads and exports traces/metrics to OTEL collector.

## Actual
Plugin crashes on startup due to OpenTelemetry SDK version mismatch.

Likely cause: The bundled @opentelemetry packages have breaking changes between versions. The plugin may need pinned versions or updated imports.
```

## Next diagnostic steps (recommended)
1. Confirm your OpenClaw version and Node.js version.
2. Capture gateway logs around the failure.
3. Check network/DNS reachability for any external APIs involved.
4. Compare your config with known-good examples in our Guides.
