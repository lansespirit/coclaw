```
## Description
Telegram bot connects to the gateway without errors, but does not receive any messages sent to it. The bot appears online on Telegram and `getMe` API calls succeed, but messages never reach the OpenClaw gateway.

## Environment
- **OpenClaw Version**: 2026.1.29 (6522de6)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal)
- **Node Version**: 24.13.0 (via nvm)
- **Installation Method**: Cloned from GitHub, built with pnpm
- **Gateway Mode**: Local (loopback only, port 18789)

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Installed OpenClaw from source: `git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git`
2. Built with: `pnpm install && pnpm ui:build && pnpm build`
3. Ran onboarding: `pnpm openclaw onboard --install-daemon`
4. Created Telegram bot via @BotFather, obtained token
5. Added token to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "botToken": "TOKEN_HERE"
    }
  }
}
```
6. Started gateway: `pnpm openclaw gateway start`
7. Sent messages to the bot on Telegram - **no response, no logs showing message receipt**

## Expected Behavior
Messages sent to the Telegram bot should:
1. Appear in gateway logs
2. Trigger pairing flow (if dmPolicy is "pairing
```

## Next diagnostic steps (recommended)
1. Confirm your OpenClaw version and Node.js version.
2. Capture gateway logs around the failure.
3. Check network/DNS reachability for any external APIs involved.
4. Compare your config with known-good examples in our Guides.
