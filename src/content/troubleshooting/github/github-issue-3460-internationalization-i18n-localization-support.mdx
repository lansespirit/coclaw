## What users report

## Summary

We've received multiple requests and PRs for internationalization (i18n) and localization support. We appreciate the community's interest in making Moltbot accessible to more users worldwide!

**However, we don't currently have the bandwidth to properly support multiple languages.**

## Why we're consolidating this

- Maintaining translations requires ongoing effort as the product evolves
- We need to establish a proper i18n architecture first
- Quality translations need review by native speakers
- Documentation, error messages, and UI all need coordinated translation

## What this means

- **New PRs adding translations will be closed** and pointed to this issue
- **Issues requesting specific languages will be closed** as duplicates of this one
- When we're ready, we'll announce the i18n initiative here

## Languages requested (tracking)

- [ ] Chinese (Simplified) - zh-CN
- [ ] Chinese (Traditional) - zh-TW  
- [ ] Portuguese (Brazilian) - pt-BR
- [ ] Korean - ko
- [ ] Japanese - ja
- [ ] Spanish - es
- [ ] French - fr
- [ ] German - de
- [ ] Vietnamese - vi
- [ ] Filipino - fi
