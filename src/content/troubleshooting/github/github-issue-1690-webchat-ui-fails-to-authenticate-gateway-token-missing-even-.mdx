## Bug Description

The webchat/dashboard UI fails to connect to the gateway websocket with the error:

```
disconnected (1008): unauthorized: gateway token missing (set gateway.remote.token to match gateway.auth.token)
```

## Environment
- macOS 26.2 (arm64)
- Node 25.2.1
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.22
- Gateway bound to loopback (127.0.0.1:18789)
- Auth mode: token

## Configuration
```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "mode": "local",
    "auth": {
      "mode": "token",
      "token": "<redacted>"
    },
    "port": 18789,
    "bind": "loopback",
    "remote": {
      "token": "<redacted>"  // Added this to match auth.token, still fails
    }
  }
}
```

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Configure gateway with `auth.mode: "token"` and set a token
2. Run `clawdbot gateway start`
3. Run `clawdbot dashboard` (or open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/chat?token=<token>`)
4. Dashboard UI loads but websocket connection fails with unauthorized error

## What I Tried
- Adding token to URL query string: `?token=xxx` — doesn't work
- Running `clawdbot dashboard` which should provide tokenized URL — doesn't work
- Adding `gateway.remote.token` to config to match `gateway.auth.token` — doesn't work
- Setting `gatewa
```

## Next diagnostic steps (recommended)
1. Confirm your OpenClaw version and Node.js version.
2. Capture gateway logs around the failure.
3. Check network/DNS reachability for any external APIs involved.
4. Compare your config with known-good examples in our Guides.
