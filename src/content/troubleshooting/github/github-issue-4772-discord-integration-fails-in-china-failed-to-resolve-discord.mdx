# Discord Integration Fails in China with "Failed to resolve Discord application id"

## Environment
- **OpenClaw Version**: 2026.1.29
- **Node.js Version**: v22.14.0
- **OS**: macOS (Darwin 25.2.0 arm64)
- **Location**: China (behind GFW)
- **Network**: Direct connection (no proxy for Discord domains)

## Problem Description

Discord bot integration consistently fails with error:
```
[discord] [default] channel exited: Failed to resolve Discord application id
```

The Discord provider starts but immediately exits within ~250ms, unable to fetch the application ID from Discord API.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create Discord bot with valid token in Discord Developer Portal
2. Enable required intents (Message Content Intent, Server Members Intent)
3. Configure OpenClaw with:
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "discord": {
      "enabled": true,
      "token": "VALID_BOT_TOKEN",
      "groupPolicy": "open",
      "dm": {
        "enabled": true,
        "policy": "open",
        "allowFrom": ["*"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
4. Start OpenClaw Gateway
5. Discord provider fails immediately

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Network Timeout (Primary)
The `fetchDiscordApplicationId()` function in
```

## Next diagnostic steps (recommended)
1. Confirm your OpenClaw version and Node.js version.
2. Capture gateway logs around the failure.
3. Check network/DNS reachability for any external APIs involved.
4. Compare your config with known-good examples in our Guides.
