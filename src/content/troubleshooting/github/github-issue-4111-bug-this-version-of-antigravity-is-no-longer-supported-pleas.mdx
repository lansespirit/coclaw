## What users report

```
Summary
The bot fails to generate responses and returns a "This version of Antigravity is no longer supported" error. This indicates the local google-antigravity provider or the bot instance is outdated and being rejected by the upstream API.

Steps to reproduce
Start the Molt bot instance.

Send a message or command to the bot to trigger a response (e.g., in a DM or channel).

Wait for the response.

Expected behavior
The bot should process the prompt and reply with generated text/content.

Actual behavior
The bot does not reply with content. Instead, the logs (or the bot's error reply) show the message: This version of Antigravity is no longer supported. Please update to receive the latest features!

Environment
Clawdbot/Moltbot version: (Run moltbot version or clawdbot version and paste here, e.g., v0.9.1)

OS: ARCH Linux

Install method: (e.g., Docker, npm install, git clone)

```

## Next diagnostic steps (recommended)
1. Confirm your OpenClaw version and Node.js version.
2. Capture gateway logs around the failure.
3. Check network/DNS reachability for any external APIs involved.
4. Compare your config with known-good examples in our Guides.
