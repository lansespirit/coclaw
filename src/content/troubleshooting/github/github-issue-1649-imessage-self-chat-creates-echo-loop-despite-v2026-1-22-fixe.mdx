## What users report

```
## Bug Description
Message echo loop occurs when user messages themselves via iMessage, despite fixes in v2026.1.10-1.16 (#655, #659, #1031, #1080).

## Environment
- **Clawdbot version:** v2026.1.22 (now updated to v2026.1.23-1)
- **OS:** macOS
- **imsg CLI:** Installed and configured

## Configuration
```json
"imessage": {
  "enabled": true,
  "cliPath": "imsg",
  "dmPolicy": "allowlist",
  "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
  "allowFrom": ["<user's own phone number>"]
}
```

**Critical detail:** User's own phone number is in the `allowFrom` list, creating a self-chat scenario.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Configure iMessage provider with user's own number in `allowFrom`
2. Send a message to yourself via iMessage
3. Clawdbot processes the message and sends a response
4. Clawdbot echoes its own response back as a new "incoming" message
5. Loop continues indefinitely

## Expected Behavior
Deduplication logic should prevent Claude's own responses from being processed as new incoming messages, even in self-chat scenarios.

## Actual Behavior
Each outbound message from Claude is echoed back as an incoming message, triggering a new API call. Loop continues until manually stopped.

## Next diagnostic steps (recommended)
1. Confirm your OpenClaw version and Node.js version.
2. Capture gateway logs around the failure.
3. Check network/DNS reachability for any external APIs involved.
4. Compare your config with known-good examples in our Guides.
