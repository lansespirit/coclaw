## Summary
Switching to Claude Sonnet model causes massive token consumption (~15% of session quota) 
with no actual API calls or chat activity. Same operations with GLM result in ~1% usage.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Start session with GLM-4.7 (or any cheap model)
2. Call `session_status --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
3. Check rate limit immediately after
4. Observe 15% jump in session usage (59% → 74%)

## Expected behavior
Model switching should use minimal tokens for the status check only (~few hundred tokens).
Should be consistent with other model switches (GLM, DeepSeek).

## Actual behavior
Single `session_status` call with Sonnet consumed ~15% of hourly quota.
- Session context: 39k tokens
- Only action: one status check
- No chat messages sent/received
- GLM same operation: +1% usage (normal)

## Environment
- Clawdbot version: 2026.1.24-3
- OS: Linux 6.8.0-90-generic (x64)
- Install method: npm (node 
```

## Next diagnostic steps (recommended)
1. Confirm your OpenClaw version and Node.js version.
2. Capture gateway logs around the failure.
3. Check network/DNS reachability for any external APIs involved.
4. Compare your config with known-good examples in our Guides.
