- Comments: `6`

## What users report

```
## Description

When using `openrouter/auto` as the default model, messages fail with:

```
Error: Unknown model: openrouter/auto
```

## Root Cause

Model ref parsing mismatch between Clawdbot and pi-ai:

1. **pi-ai stores the model** under `modelRegistry["openrouter"]["openrouter/auto"]`
2. **Clawdbot's `parseModelRef()`** splits at first `/` → `provider="openrouter", model="auto"`
3. **Lookup fails**: `getModel("openrouter", "auto")` returns undefined

## Expected Behavior

`openrouter/auto` should work. OpenRouter's API accepts `model: "openrouter/auto"` for their auto-routing.

## Workaround

Use a specific model instead of `openrouter/auto` as default.

## Environment

- Clawdbot: 2026.1.24-3
- Node: v22.22.0

## Suggested Fix

Handle special case where model ID includes provider prefix (like `openrouter/auto`).
```

## Next diagnostic steps (recommended)
1. Confirm your OpenClaw version and Node.js version.
2. Capture gateway logs around the failure.
3. Check network/DNS reachability for any external APIs involved.
4. Compare your config with known-good examples in our Guides.
