## Description

When using MiniMax models (e.g., `minimax-cn/MiniMax-M2.1`) in the TUI, responses display as `(no output)` even though the model returns content successfully. The same responses display correctly in Telegram.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Configure MiniMax as a provider with valid API key
2. Set model to `minimax-cn/MiniMax-M2.1` (via `/model m2cn` or config)
3. Send a message in the TUI
4. Observe: TUI shows `(no output)`
5. Check Telegram: Same message displays correctly
6. Restart TUI
7. Observe: Now historical responses display correctly

## Expected Behavior

MiniMax responses should render immediately in the TUI without requiring a restart.

## Actual Behavior

- TUI shows `(no output)` for MiniMax responses
- Telegram renders the same responses correctly
- Restarting TUI fixes the display issue retroactively

## Possible Cause

The TUI may be expecting Anthropic-specific response format or handling streaming differently for non-Anthropic providers. MiniMax uses an Anthropic-compatible API but may have slight format differences in the response structure.

From session logs, MiniMax returns:
```json
{
  "thinking": "...",
  "text": "..."
}
```

The TUI might not b

## Next diagnostic steps (recommended)
1. Confirm your OpenClaw version and Node.js version.
2. Capture gateway logs around the failure.
3. Check network/DNS reachability for any external APIs involved.
4. Compare your config with known-good examples in our Guides.
