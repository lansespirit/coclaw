## What users report

```
(placeholder created on phone)

an opus model model translates english docs to chinese. it's mostly good but sometimes not. share bad translations here so we can RL the model and prompt opus to do better. 

the more context you can share for the LLM, the better, as i can just tell the LLM "read the comments on issue XYZ" and the LLM can correct the translation pipeline.

please do NOT open individual PRs for translation issues - this is much more effective and lets us solve the problem going forward for ALL documentation 😇
```

## Next diagnostic steps (recommended)
1. Confirm your OpenClaw version and Node.js version.
2. Capture gateway logs around the failure.
3. Check network/DNS reachability for any external APIs involved.
4. Compare your config with known-good examples in our Guides.
