## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 22+** (Node 22 LTS recommended) installed on your system
- A terminal or command prompt
- Basic familiarity with command-line tools

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Node.js

If you don't have Node.js installed, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

```bash
# Verify Node.js installation
node --version
```

### 2. Install OpenClaw

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g openclaw@latest

# Or using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm add -g openclaw@latest
```

### 3. Run the Setup Wizard

```bash
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

This creates your config at `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` and installs a per-user Gateway service.

### 4. Open the Dashboard

```bash
openclaw dashboard
```

You can also open http://127.0.0.1:18789/. If you see “unauthorized”, run `openclaw dashboard` and
use the tokenized link it prints (`?token=...`).
