  - title: "Start with a dedicated number (recommended)"
    content: >
      If possible, use a separate phone number for the assistant. This reduces account risk and
      avoids self-chat quirks.
  - title: "Add minimal WhatsApp config"
    content: >
      In `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`, configure WhatsApp with a conservative DM policy and allowlist
      (e.g., `dmPolicy: "allowlist"` + `allowFrom: ["+15551234567"]`).
  - title: "Log in (scan QR)"
    content: >
      Run `openclaw channels login` and scan the QR code using WhatsApp -> Linked Devices -> Link a
      device.
  - title: "Pairing (optional)"
    content: >
      If you use pairing for unknown senders, approve requests with
      `openclaw pairing list whatsapp` and `openclaw pairing approve whatsapp <code>`.
