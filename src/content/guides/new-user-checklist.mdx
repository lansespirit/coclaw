      Back up the full state dir (default `~/.openclaw/`). It contains config, creds, sessions, and workspace data.

      `openclaw gateway status`, `openclaw health`, and `openclaw logs --follow` solve most early mysteries.

## What this checklist is optimizing for

New users generally want three things:

1. A working install (fast)
2. A safe install (not an open relay / not public)
3. A recoverable install (backups + upgrades without pain)

Official references:

- Dashboard (Control UI): https://docs.openclaw.ai/web/dashboard
- Updating: https://docs.openclaw.ai/install/updating
- Gateway runbook: https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway

## 1) Install + daemonize the gateway (recommended)

Runtime requirement: Node >= 22.

Global install:

```bash
npm install -g openclaw@latest
# or:
pnpm add -g openclaw@latest
```

Run onboarding (recommended path):

```bash
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

This installs a per-user supervised service (launchd on macOS, systemd user service on Linux/WSL2)
so the gateway keeps running in the background.

## 2) Dashboard access: avoid the "unauthorized" trap

The Control UI is served by the gateway (default http://127.0.0.1:18789/), but auth is enforced.

If you open the URL and see "unauthorized":

```bash
openclaw dashboard
```

Use the tokenized link it prints (`?token=...`). The UI stores the token locally after first load.

## 3) Secure inbound messaging (do not run "open" by accident)

The most common beginner mistake is leaving a DM policy too permissive.

Recommended pattern:

- DMs: `pairing` (approve new senders) or `allowlist`
- Groups: require mentions by default (so the bot does not reply to everything)

Examples:

- Telegram guide: `/guides/telegram-setup`
- WhatsApp guide: `/guides/whatsapp-setup`

## 4) Back up the correct thing: the state directory

OpenClaw is stateful. Back up the full state directory:

- Default: `~/.openclaw/`

It includes:

- config (`openclaw.json`)
- credentials (OAuth tokens, channel creds)
- sessions
- workspace files

Simple backup:

```bash
tar -czf openclaw-state-backup.tgz ~/.openclaw
```

Security note: treat backups like secrets.

## 5) Updates: prefer the boring path

For global installs, update like this:

```bash
npm i -g openclaw@latest
openclaw doctor
openclaw gateway restart
openclaw health
```

If something breaks after an update:

- do not "randomly reinstall" first
- capture status + logs, then rollback or adjust config

## 6) The 3 commands that solve most early problems

Gateway supervisor + probe:

```bash
openclaw gateway status
```

Health snapshot:

```bash
openclaw health
```

Live logs:

```bash
openclaw logs --follow
```

## 7) First-week wins (high ROI)

- Set a strict DM policy for every channel you enable.
- Decide your remote access story early (SSH tunnel vs Tailscale). Avoid public exposure of the Control UI.
- Add a scheduled backup of `~/.openclaw/`.
- Keep a "rescue path": you should be able to reinstall OpenClaw and restore state in under 15 minutes.
