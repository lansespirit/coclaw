  - title: "Prerequisites"
    content: >
      Install Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine) and Docker Compose v2. Ensure you have enough disk
      space for images and logs.
  - title: "Clone the OpenClaw repo"
    content: >
      Clone the official OpenClaw repository. The Docker quick-start script lives in the repo root.
  - title: "Run the Docker quick start"
    content: >
      From the repo root, run `./docker-setup.sh`. It builds the gateway image, runs onboarding,
      starts the gateway via Docker Compose, and generates a gateway token in `.env`.
  - title: "Open the dashboard (Control UI)"
    content: >
      Open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/`. If prompted, paste the gateway token (Settings -> token).
  - title: "Optional: configure channels"
    content: >
      Use the CLI container to configure channels (e.g., WhatsApp QR:
      `docker compose run --rm openclaw-cli channels login`). Then restart the gateway container if
      needed.
