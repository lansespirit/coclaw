          CoClaw ("we", "us") is a community-maintained website at <strong>coclaw.com</strong>. This
          Privacy Policy explains what information we collect when you visit the site, how we use
          it, and the choices you have.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Collect</h2>
        <h3>Information you provide</h3>
        <p>
          CoClaw does not currently require account creation. If you contact us by email or via
          community links (e.g., forum/Discord), you may share information you choose to provide
          (such as your email address and message content).
        </p>

        <h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
        <p>
          Like most websites, our hosting provider may collect standard server logs (for example, IP
          address, user-agent, and request metadata) for security, abuse prevention, and
          reliability.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services We Use</h2>
        <p>
          Some pages may load resources from third parties. When your browser loads these resources,
          those providers may receive your IP address and browser details.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Cloudflare Pages</strong> (hosting / CDN).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Google Fonts</strong> (the Inter font is loaded from fonts.googleapis.com).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>YouTube</strong> (if you play embedded videos).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unsplash</strong> (some images used in blog articles).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To serve pages and provide requested site functionality.</li>
          <li>To protect the site against abuse and maintain reliability.</li>
          <li>To respond to inquiries you send us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>
          CoClaw does not currently run first-party analytics scripts. However, third-party services
          (such as embedded video providers) may set cookies or similar technologies when you
          interact with their embeds.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain information only as long as necessary for the purposes described above, unless a
          longer retention period is required for security or legal reasons (e.g., hosting logs).
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          We take reasonable steps to protect the site. No method of transmission over the internet
          is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this policy from time to time. We will revise the "Last updated" date at the
          top of this page when changes are made.
